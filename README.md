# Model Performance Evaluation for Fuel Cell Performance Data

## My Roll Number:
- **Roll Number:** 102203781
- **Target Used:** Target2

---

## Steps Followed:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Filtered the dataset to select **Target2** based on my roll number (ends with 1).
   - Split the data into **70% training** and **30% testing**.

### 2. **Modeling with PyCaret:**
   - Used **PyCaret** to compare multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
   - **Linear Regression** was chosen as the best model based on its performance.

### 3. **Model Evaluation:**

| Metric                | Value      | Pre-requisite Definition                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | 0.125      | Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Lower MAE indicates better accuracy. |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  | 0.0248     | Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Smaller MSE indicates fewer large errors. |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | 0.1576     | The square root of MSE, giving the error in the original units of the target variable. Lower RMSE indicates better model accuracy. |
| **R2 Score**           | 0.9156     | The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Values closer to 1 indicate better model fit. |

## Conclusion:
- The **Linear Regression** model performed well with an **R2 score of 0.9156** and relatively low error metrics.
- The model provides accurate and reliable predictions, making it the best model after comparison using **PyCaret**.
